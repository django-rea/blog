Kamasi is an opensource project that want to provide a usable and mobile friendly web app, to let people manage the value accounting of different projects, according to the valueflow (https://www.valueflo.ws/) vocabulary and the REA ontology.

Kamasi is a client app made in React that implement a GraphQl layer with the specific intention to let the client be agnostic from any server implementation (actually its a django backend, maybe tomorrow a scuttlebot one?).

The project born from the OCP backend, an NRP fork developed by Faircoop (http://fair.coop), in order to manage projects related to their European Cooperative: FreedomCoop (http://freedomcoop.eu).

Valueflow is an extraordinary attempt to create a shared taxonomy in order to boost the collaborative economy and complex organizations on internet.

We strongly believe that we need more open source tools that allow us to extends our autonomy and self-organizations on the web, without depends on third-part centralized service and that’s why we’re building Kamasi.
